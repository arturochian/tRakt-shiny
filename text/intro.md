## Hi there.
<p class = "lead">This is `tRakt` or `tRakt_shiny` or whatever (naming stuff is hard).</p>

<p class = "lead">It's a tool to look up tv shows from <a href = 'http://trakt.tv'>trakt.tv</a> <sup><small>which y'all should use anyway</small></sup> and receive some more or less fancy data, including plots with reasonable amounts of fancyness.</p>

## Quick status update

I'm currently rewriting the package to handle all the trakt.tv API stuff because of their [new API](http://docs.trakt.apiary.io/),
and in the process of thisâ€¦ well, things got messy and to make the search work, some other stuff broke.  

If you like, you can keep an eye on [the package](https://github.com/jemus42/tRakt-package) 
and [my #pants](http://pants.jemu.name) to see what's going on.


### How do you even stuff

* Enter a show title in the search box below 
* **Or** select one from the cache and leave the search box empty
* You can fiddle around with the plot with the inputs on the right
* Or just look at the dataTables, idunno

<small>Also, pls tell me about bugs 'n stuff, k?</small>
