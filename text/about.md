## What

This is a shiny version of [a trakt experiment](https://github.com/jemus42/tRakt).  
It is highly experimental, early in development and pretty much broken… ish.  
If you want to look at it or help out, the source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jemus42/tRakt-shiny).  

I recently started to make little update notes [on my #pants](http://pants.jemu.name//tag/trakt_shiny),  
so if you want to keep up with minor or major changes, there's the place to do that.

You may already know [grapthv](http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com), which does a much smoother job of displaying tv show ratings,  
but its functionality is fairly basic, and I intend to exceed it with this project.   
Besides, I prefer [trakt](http://trakt.tv) over IMDb for tv show data, even if trakt doesn't nearly have the userbase of IMDb.  
It's a familiarity thing. <small>Also, trakt has a public API</small>

Soo… Even if I'll never reach the smoothness/speed of graphtv,  
I can at least try do some other interesting stuff with the data.  
At least I hope so.  
We'll see.
